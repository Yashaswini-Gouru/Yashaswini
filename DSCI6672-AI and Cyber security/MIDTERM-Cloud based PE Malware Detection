This is the code written in a pynb for training a deep neural network for binary Malware Classification. The dataset used is EMBER 2017 version 2. EMBER stands for Endgame Malware Benchmark for Research which is a large dataset composed of labeled and unlabeled samples of parsed features of PE header files from binaries under 2MB. Extracting and vectorizing features of these samples can be done through project LIEF's library which is bundled at the EMBER's GitHub.

More information about them can be found on their GitHub: https://github.com/endgameinc/ember/tree/master/malconv

The midterm is composed of three tasks: Making a deep neural network, deploying it to the cloud via Amazon SagaMaker, and creating a script for say a client to use to determine a single PE file  is malicious or benign. 

Task 1: Completed. Can be found in Training the model.ipynb file. 

Task 2: Completed. Deploying model.ipynb.

Task 3: Completed. Can be found in client keys.ipynb.
