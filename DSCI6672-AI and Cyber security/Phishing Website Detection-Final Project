Project:
The aim of the project is to extract the features from the phishing URL's and Legitimate URL's and differentiate them.

The dataset has two text files one with Phishing Url's and the other with legitimate url's.
Extracting the features from the urls code is present in FeatureExtraction.ipynb file.
The Extracted features has vales 0,1,2.
Where Legitimate-0
      Phishing-1
      Suspicious-2
    
 The Extracted features are formed as Dataframes.
 The Models used for Prediction are:
   Decision Tree Classifier
   Random Forest Classifier
   Logistic Regression
   K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
   Grid Search
   Neutral Networks
   
  The Accuracies ,Confusion matrix and False positive rates for all the models are obtained.
